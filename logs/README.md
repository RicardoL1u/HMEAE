# Training Logs

### Update
Now codes use ```train.txt```, ```dev.txt``` and ```text.txt``` split as default. This is a commonly used split.

### Content
```split.json``` is one possible split to conduct experiments.
```.txt``` are training logs under such split, you will get similar results if you follow such split.

### Usage
The code use this split by default. If you want to use your own split, you can modify ```split.json``` and re-extract.

### Note
Some other splits may also achieve same or even better results, this split is just for a reference and is **NOT THE ONLY FEASIBLE** split.
